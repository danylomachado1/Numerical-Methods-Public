# Numerical-Methods-Public

In this repository you will see different numerical methods aplied to general physics:

-Non-linear equations.

-Linear systems - Direct methods.

-Linear systems - Iterative methods.

-Polynomial interpolation.

-Adjustment of curves.

-Numerical integration and differentiation.

-Ordinary differential equations.

-Problems border conditions.

-Partial differential equations (parabolic and hyperbolic)

-Finite elements.

The problems solved in this repository were extracted from different books focused in numerical methods for physics and engineering.
