# Numerical-Methods-Public

In this repository you will find different numerical methods applied to general physics such as:

* Non-linear equations.
* Linear systems - Direct methods.
* Linear systems - Iterative methods.
* Polynomial interpolation.
* Fit of curves.
* Numerical integration and differentiation.
* Ordinary differential equations.
* Boundary condition problems.
* Partial differential equations (parabolic and hyperbolic)
* Finite elements.

The problems solved in this repository were extracted from different books focused in numerical methods for physics and engineering.
These codes have been written under Python 3.6.9
